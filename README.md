### Motivation

This is my example of using RxSwift to build MVVM-Coordnator application. The project has two purposes:
- it's a place for me to trying out new things that I'm gradualy going to learn
- and to share some of practices that I learnt with others

I really hope that someone will benefit from this, if so, I can't wait to hear about it <boguslaw.parol@gmail.com>

### The APP
It's very simple, it has two screens: one for displaying list of posts, second one to display post details. Also, user can display list of posts from particular user. UI is very simple and it was not my main focus ;)

### MVVM-C 
Some stuff will appear here soon...
