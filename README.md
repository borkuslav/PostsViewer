### Motivation

This is my example of using RxSwift to build MVVM-Coordnator application. The project has two purposes:
- it's a place for me to trying out new things that I'm gradualy going to learn
- and to share some of practices that I learnt with others

I really hope that someone will benefit from this, if so, I can't wait to hear about it <boguslaw.parol@gmail.com>

### MVVM-C 
Some stuff will appear here soon...
